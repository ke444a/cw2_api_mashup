# Vapour: Game Price collation service
_Group-based coursework: web application that interacts with two pre-existing web APIs_

__“Vapour”__ is a digital game pricing service that deduces the cheapest price on video games from a variety of storefronts and presents it to the user. In addition, the service provides the user with detailed information about each game as well as ability to click through to the actual store to make their purchase with the cheapest price available. The goal of our project is to save users time and money by providing an easy-to-use platform for finding the best prices on the games they love.
